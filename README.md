Here i have used dynamic programming to solve this problem --- as given in the problem statement i have 3 ways to move from one position to other ---so i made a help function to apply the logic to get maximum moves among  all the 3 possible ways --then in the maxMoves i have iterated the help function among all the possible starting position .
and finally got the maximum among all of them.
